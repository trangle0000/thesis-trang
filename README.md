## Master thesis

### ToDo

- We need to move whatever is in the quarto document into the main LaTeX file and we need to think about how to do it and where to put this information in the main thesis.
- Think and find the data set that we can use to have the case study in the main paper (for example `Sepsis Cases - Event Log.xes.gz`), https://data.4tu.nl/articles/_/12707639/1.  This is up to you what you select.
- Change the name of the file test.py to example01.py
- Create a second example that is more advanced. For example, let it contain loops.
